One faction was loyal to President Salva Kiir, while the other faction was loyal to the former vice-president Riek Machar. Machar had been ousted from the government in July 2013. In mid-December, President Kiir accused Riek Machar of conducting a coup d’état, but this accusation later proved to be unsubstantiated. The accusation is widely seen as a pretext for crack down on Machar and pushing all Nuer troops out of Juba, after which Nuer civilians were targeted. Armed clashes between the conflict parties quickly spread to other areas, in particular to Bor, Malakal, and Bentiu. In response to the armed conflict, Salva Kiir also detained a group of eleven high-profile individuals, accusing them of conspiring with Riek Machar to overthrow the government.

Kiir had cast aside the power-sharing formula of the ARCSS in October 2015 through creating 28 states instead of ten states. In addition, in violation to the agreement, Chief of Staff Paul Malong had secretly brought a Dinka militia to Juba. With tensions increasing, fighting between the conflict parties eventually resumed in July 2016. This effectively suspended the peace process. Following the clashes, President Kiir issued a decree on an immediate ceasefire in the country on 11 July 2016. Yet, fighting continued. Riek Machar subsequently fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo while under attack of ground forces and helicopter gunships. Taban Deng Gai sought the support of some disgruntled SPLM/A-IO generals, after which Kiir appointed Taban Deng Gai as the vice president, replacing Machar. Riek Machar was later put under house arrest in South Africa. However, most of the SPLM/A-IO remained loyal to Machar.

“We’re currently in the middle of the dry season here,” he continues. “It’s always a tricky time because nomadic herders start moving their livestock to find grazing land and water. This cross-country movement creates tensions with those farming settled lands. Herders sometimes allow cattle to graze on cultivated crops and farmers retaliate to protect their resources which can lead to conflict, loss of life and displacement,” reveals SRSG Shearer.

To reduce the risk of violence, UNMISS peacekeepers have adopted a more mobile approach by establishing temporary operating bases near seasonal cattle migration routes.

This event offers a platform for South Sudan’s leaders to develop mutual priorities for an interconnected and purposeful government, one that is equipped to advance the search for lasting peace in South Sudan.

Following the appointment of state governors and other constitutional post holders, UNMISS had immediately embarked on a series of interactive dialogues to foster political cohesion and trust between members of the coalition state governments.

As precursor to this Forum, UNMISS facilitated nine Governor’s Forums in all states except Unity, due to devastating floods. These events facilitated engagements between state governors and local stakeholders to identify governance-related priorities in their respective states and prepare action plans towards delivering them.

We are pleased that these Governors’ Forums led to the creation of a strategic plan for each state, addressing priorities enshrined in the Revitalized Agreement. These plans will be presented to you here over the coming days.
We have also organised six State Leadership Retreats around the theme of “Building Trust and Confidence for United and Inclusive Governments”. Here, we disseminated the Revitalized Agreement to encourage greater ownership of its priorities. Importantly, these retreats offered an opportunity for the state governments to better appreciate their respective roles and to foster the much-needed state-level synergies for unity.

These activities served as a timely entry point for capacity-building, training, and general brainstorming. They also offered a formal introduction for newly appointed office holders at the grassroots level.

People living in Lohutok and Ibahure payams (administrative divisions) are perhaps worst affected by this ongoing violence, as a patrol team from the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) discovered.

“We are tired of the constant fighting,” stated Pasqual Osenger, a traditional leader from Lohutok, to visiting peacekeepers. “It has left us without security, affected our crops and livestock and our general quality of life. We request UNMISS to ensure that this conflict between our communities ends once and for all.”

Lack of proper rule of law and security institutions in the area have, unfortunately, empowered perpetrators.

While speaking to the patrolling peacekeepers, community leaders stressed the need for established law and order mechanisms as well as reconciliation activities here. “To keep the peace between us, we believe we need a proper security system and well-demarcated areas where both communities can coexist peacefully,” added Mr. Osenger.

UNMISS has made several efforts in the past to reconcile the communities of these two payams. However, the peacekeeping mission hasn’t had much success in establishing a sustained peace.

“The UN has tried many times to resolve issues between us,” revealed a youth representative. “However, because of our own long history and disagreements between our leaders, no agreement has held till now. We seem to relapse into conflict at the slightest issue and we are aware that this must stop.”

For its part, UNMISS, through its Civil Affairs Division, has re-started engaging with communities across South Sudan in general, and Lafon, in particular, to sensitize them on the provisions contained within the Revitalized Peace Agreement.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/traditional-leaders-lopit-call-unmiss-reconcile-feuding-communities-lafon-eastern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accompanied by Anastasie Nyirigira Mukangarambe, the Head of the UNMISS Field Office in the state, Force Commander Tinaikar was also joined by state officials, including Acting State Governor Debora Uduel Akiech and other prominent state authorities.

The Force Commander’s visit came on the heels of recent intercommunal clashes. The most recent upsurge of violence in early July displaced some 5,000 people; schools, churches, and health centers were vandalized and a World Food Programme warehouse was looted by armed youth .

Wol Mario Maalok, acting payam administrator in Marial Lou briefed the visiting delegation on the situation. “The conflict between all of us has taken a toll and all parties have agreed that the only way forward for us is to resolve things peacefully so that our children can live free of fear and retaliation. In fact, many people who had fled when the clashes initially began, have now started returning to their homes.”

However, humanitarian needs still to be addressed.

“We lack medical facilities, shelter and food, though the presence of UNMISS peacekeepers here has enabled hospital staff to resume their duties. Many people lost everything during the conflict, and they need help to get back on their feet,” added Mr Maalok.

For her part, Acting Governor Akiech reiterated the state administration’s commitment to supporting long-term peace and conflict resolution in Marial Lou, saying that the government is in the process of convening a peace dialogue between the three feuding communities.

“The frictions we are witnessing risk leading to intercommunal conflicts resulting in huge losses of lives and property. For this reason, our youth must change their attitudes when it comes to revenge attacks. They need to understand that peaceful dialogue is the way to create social cohesion and unity,” said Santino Kornick Sali, Executive Director in Raja County.

The interactive sessions dealt with a range of topics such as the Revitalized Peace Agreement, the government’s perspective on inter-county coordination, early warning mechanisms, the role of traditional authorities in conflict prevention and reconciliation, and the vital contributions of women as well as youth in promoting peace.

Ministers and Deputy Ministers,

Members of Parliament and the Council of States,

Excellencies and distinguished guests,

I am deeply honored to address the commencement of the Sixth Governor’s Forum, which recognizes the urgency of implementing the 2022 Roadmap. This is an opportunity to reflect on South Sudan’s recommitment to the Revitalized Peace Agreement. I commend the leadership of South Sudan’s government and the parties for reaching a consensus on the way forward and the ratification of the Roadmap only last week by the Transitional National Legislature.

I am pleased to see the nation’s leaders - from the bomas, payams, counties and capitals - coming together under one roof under the leadership of the government of the country. And over the next week, you will take forward conversations generated at state-level to inform a common understanding of priorities and challenges at the national level. A key theme of your deliberations will be the pathways towards a stable and prosperous nation so that every woman, man and child can benefit both peace and the natural abundance of this country. This process carries with it the added strength of the states moving together with the center, reinforced by the participation of civil society, of partners and the international community. We look forward to the full inclusion of women’s voices in this important dialogue.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/sixth-governors-forum-statement-mr-nicholas-haysom-special-representative-secretary-general-and-head-unmiss,,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/sixth-governors-forum-closing-session-statement-mr-nicholas-haysom-special-representative-secretary-general-and-head-unmiss-30-november-2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The meeting, which was held in Juba, was co-chaired by the Sudanese Minister of Defence, Lieutenant General Yassin Ibrahim Yassin, and the South Sudan Minister of Defence and Veterans Affairs, Hon. Angelina Teny. Their delegations included Ministers and high-level representatives of security institutions. The collective vision of the parties was to operationalize the commitments made by H.E Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan and H.E Abdel Fattah Al Burhan, Chairman of the Transitional Sovereign Council of Sudan during their meeting in Juba on 12 January 2023, which focused on the strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries.

The UNISFA delegation, led by the Deputy Force Commander Brig. Gen. Abu Syed Mohammod Bakir, highlighted the challenging security situation in Abyei and the Safe Demilitarized Border Zone (SDBZ) and the need for concerted efforts to enhance the protection of civilians. UNISFA also underscored several issues, including the need to reoperationalize the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (JBVMM) Sector 1 (Gok Machar), the deployment of national monitors at Abu Qussa, the redeployment of government forces from Abyei and the SDBZ and freedom of movement challenges. Other matters discussed included support for the commencement of intercommunal talks, including the seasonal peace conference, and the resumption of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee meetings.

The parties welcomed the report presented by UNISFA and JBVMM and adopted its recommendations. They directed the Chief of Defence Forces of the Republic of South Sudan and the Chief of Staff of the Sudanese Armed Forces to inter alia form a committee to “monitor the implementation of the resolution of the JPSM regarding the redeployment of own forces outside of the SDBZ”.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/parties-agree-hasten-implementation-decisions-during-jpsm-meeting-juba,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
