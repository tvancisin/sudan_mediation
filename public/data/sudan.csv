However, on 16 August 1986, the peace talks were suspended due to the SPLM/A bombing a civil airplane, which resulted in the death of 60 passengers. Egypt – in spite of its military support to the Government of Sudan – managed to facilitate contacts between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and SPLM/A in the mid-1988. The DUP was one of the three parties in Khartoum’s ruling coalition. Ethiopia subsequently offered to host talks in Addis Ababa between the DUP and the SPLM/A. This led to the signing of what has been referred to as the DUP-SPLM/A Sudan Peace Agreement on 16 November 1988 by DUP leader Mohamed Osman al-Mirghani and SPLM/A leader John Garang de Mabior. However, the agreement soon collapsed as a result of an internal power struggle within the Government of Sudan. The opposition in the coalition government, the National Islamic Front (NIF), did not accept the peace agreement, as it wished to maintain Islamic law and refused to abrogate military pacts with Egypt and Libya. The NIF denounced the talks as a conspiracy to block Islamic law. Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi voted down a DUP amendment to recognise the terms of the DUP-SPLM/A Sudan Peace Agreement. Consequently, the DUP resigned from government on 27 December 1988. In March 1989, a new Government assumed power, which proposed a peace plan that was based on the peace deal that was reached between SPLM/A and DUP in November 1988, calling for a freeze on Islamic laws.

Both Bashir and Garang accepted the invitation and the meeting was set for 27 February 1990. However, at the last minute Garang decided not to go, so only Bashir showed up.  Similarly, Zaire and Egypt mediated in 1990, but could not bring the conflict parties to the negotiation table. The Government of Sudan took the initiative in March 1990 to request the US to mediate. The US subsequently initiated a mediation effort. In order to move the conflict parties towards a peace settlement, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman Cohen began to shuttle between the conflict parties in March 1990. Cohen formulated a proposal that stipulated the conclusion of a ceasefire, withdrawal of troops, followed by a constitutional conference that would decide on a federal system. With regard to the withdrawal of troops, Cohen proposed the complete evacuation of the national army to positions north of the 11th parallel, while the SPLM/A had to guarantee that it would not take control of southern Sudan militarily if the government forces would withdraw. With neither conflict party agreeing to this proposal, Cohen subsequently formulated a new proposal, which stipulated that half of the government forces would be pulled out from southern Sudan, while the SPLM/A would in exchange withdraw all its troops 15 kilometres from the besieged towns. Moreover, the withdrawal of troops would be internationally monitored. Cohen also proposed to hold a constitutional conference . Cohen personally presented the adapted proposal to President al-Bashir in Khartoum on 9 March 1990. While al-Bashir promised Cohen to study the proposal carefully, he soon conveyed that he rejected the possibility of a constitutional conference, preferring bilateral talks with John Garrang. The Government of Sudan also refused to withdraw from some garrison towns in areas controlled by the rebels including some oil fields.  This terminated his round of shuttle talks in March 1990. In May, Cohen again tried to imitate a peace conference, but the government side officially rejected this option on 4 June 1990.""",APP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coup led to the formation of an umbrella opposition group called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). In 1990, the SPLM/A joined the NDA, which at the time was a non-militant opposition group. The NDA aimed to remove the regime and set up a democratic system in Sudan. The NDA further envisioned that as part of this new democratic system the people in the South would have the right to a referendum on self-determination. The NDA was fairly loosely organised, composed of a variety of different entities such as civil society organisations, as well as rebel groups. Groups taking part in the alliance have on several occasions acted on their own, both when it comes to negotiations with and fighting against the government. Until 1996, the NDA was a solely political platform, but in September 1996, the NDA decided to set up a joint military force. After this point the NDA was both an umbrella organisation and an organisation with its own military and commanders fighting under the NDA banner.

By the time this press statement was released the armed conflict had already begun. One of the first organized attacks took place as early as June 2002, when Darfurian rebels targeted a police station in Golo. Yet, it was not until March 2003 that the armed conflict escalated, when several coordinated armed attacks led by SLM/A leader Abdel Wahid were launched on various government army units. When the armed opposition groups took up arms, the Sudanese government initially kept the communication channels open. For instance, after the attack on the police station in Golo in June 2002, the Sudanese government dispatched the chairman of the Parliament’s Transport Commission, Idris Yusuf, to negotiate with the armed groups.  From March 2003 onwards, when attacks on government targets became more frequent, the Governor of North Darfur, Ibrahim Suleiman, formed and ad hoc Darfur Security Committee to negotiate an end to the violence in Darfur. However, this peace effort was terminated as soon as government officials had successfully negotiated the return of commander of the Sudanese air force Ibrahim Bushra, who had been captured during the attack on El Fasher airbase.

To back-up this promise, Zoellick carried personal letters with him from President George W. Bush assuring the rebel leaders of the US’s commitment to the DPA. In addition, the UN Security Council had imposed an arms embargo on all non-governmental entities operating in Darfur in July 2004. This sanctions regime was strengthened with the adoption of resolution 1591 in March 2005, which expanded the scope of arms embargo to also include all the parties to the N’djamena Ceasefire Agreement and any other belligerents, as well as imposed a travel ban and an assets freeze on individuals designated by the UN Sanctions Committee.

To back-up this promise, Zoellick carried personal letters with him from President George W. Bush assuring the rebel leaders of the US’s commitment to the DPA. In addition, the UN Security Council had imposed an arms embargo on all non-governmental entities operating in Darfur in July 2004. This sanctions regime was strengthened with the adoption of resolution 1591 in March 2005, which expanded the scope of arms embargo to also include all the parties to the N’djamena Ceasefire Agreement and any other belligerents, as well as imposed a travel ban and an assets freeze on individuals designated by the UN Sanctions Committee. In spite of the pressure put on the conflict parties to sign the peace agreement, the JEM and the SLM/A led by Abdul Wahid refused to sign the agreement, leaving the SLM/A led by Minni Minnawi as the only rebel party that signed the DPA on 5 May 2006. From the signing of the DPA on 5 May 2006 onwards, AU mediators Alex de Waal and Sam Ibok met with SLM/A leader Abdul Wahid several times a day to get clarity on his objections to the DPA. They encouraged him to write to Salim Ahmed Salim a letter in which he could specify on what was needed in order for him to sign the DPA. In his letter send to Salim on 10 May, Abdul Wahid proposed to conclude a ‘supplementary agreement’ to the DPA, demanding greater representation at the legislature and executive bodies of Darfur, as well as a larger compensation fund for Darfur. However, Salim knew that the chief government negotiator, Majzoub El Khalifa, would reject this option, instead insisting that Abdul Wahid had to sign the DPA first, after which some of the remaining issues could be negotiated. Consequently, on 13 May 2006, Salim replied to Wahid that the AU could not re-open negotiations on the DPA, but was willing to support the conflict parties in implementing the agreement. Sam Ibok subsequently tried to persuade Wahid that the AU’s insistence on implementation rather than concluding a supplementary agreement would still allow Wahid to get what he wanted. Ibok’s effort to persuade Wahid did not work. Wahid kept insisting on a supplementary agreement. The AU Peace and Security Council decided on 16 May 2006 that the non-signatory groups would have another two weeks to sign the DPA.",APP,The term 'other' refers to the USA alongside European powers sponsoring and funding talks held in Abuja to bring an end to the Darfur conflict.,https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/darfur-overview-summary.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In late 2016, the AUHIP called upon the SPLM/A-North to review their positions on the talks on the Two Areas. The SPLM/A-N insisted on a provision allowing humanitarian access through Asosa in Ethiopia, but the Sudanese government rejected such a provision. In March 2017, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army-North (SPLM/A-N) split into two factions, resulting in several clashes. While there were many calls to engage in negotiations throughout 2017 and 2018, the conflict parties did not engage in peace talks. The split was a result of long-simmering ethnic and political–military tensions within the SPLM/A-N in Blue Nile. While the Uduk, Berta, and Burun had made up the majority of the SPLM/A’s 10th Division during war between the SPLM/A and the Sudanese government between 1983 and 2005, members of the Ingessana tribe assumed increasingly more power within the rebel group from 2012 onwards. This led to widespread dissatisfaction among the non-Ingessana tribes. Tensions were temporarily put on hold due to intense fighting between the SPLM/A-N and government forces throughout 2015-2016, but following a unilateral ceasefire issued by the Sudanese government on 18 June 2016 tensions escalated. In March 2017, SPLM/A-N deputy chairman Abdelaziz al-Hilu publicly released a resignation letter. Abdelaziz al-Hilu accused Agar of not fully representing the entire SPLM/A-N movement in the peace process led by the AU, particularly with regard to the issue of self-determination of the Nuba Mountains. Al-Hilu’s letter essentially forced the members of the SPLM/A-N to choose between himself and chairman Malik Agar of the Ingessana tribe.

In late 2016, the AUHIP called upon the SPLM/A-North to review their positions on the talks on the Two Areas. The SPLM/A-N insisted on a provision allowing humanitarian access through Asosa in Ethiopia, but the Sudanese government rejected such a provision. In March 2017, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army-North (SPLM/A-N) split into two factions, resulting in several clashes. While there were many calls to engage in negotiations throughout 2017 and 2018, the conflict parties did not engage in peace talks.

Absent such deals, the Kiir-Machar truce may fail its first major test in May 2019, when the two South Sudanese leaders are scheduled to form a unity government.” On 18 October, in a communiqué, the Peace and Security Council of the AU called for the parties’ adherence to the deadline of 12 November. During its visit to South Sudan on 20 October 2019, the UN Security Council also called for adhering to the deadline, but also stressed the need to address outstanding issues. While the Government of South Sudan intended to form the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity on 12 November, the SPLM/A-IO called for an extension.""",APP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Prepared for Delivery

President Macron, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:

On behalf of World Bank Group President David Malpass—an early and vocal champion of debt relief for Sudan, allow me to convey the optimism and sense of urgency with which we look forward to the HIPC Decision Point for Sudan.

Today is indeed a historical moment. We have waited 25 years for it. We launched the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) in 1996, and much progress has been achieved in providing comprehensive debt relief. However, the biggest case – namely Sudan, always eluded us. Until now.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/speech-axel-van-trotsenburg-managing-director-operations-international-conference,"""On 17 May, France held a conference of Heads of State and Government in Paris, chaired by Emmanuel Macron, in support of Sudan’s democratic transition.

“We’re currently in the middle of the dry season here,” he continues. “It’s always a tricky time because nomadic herders start moving their livestock to find grazing land and water. This cross-country movement creates tensions with those farming settled lands. Herders sometimes allow cattle to graze on cultivated crops and farmers retaliate to protect their resources which can lead to conflict, loss of life and displacement,” reveals SRSG Shearer.

To reduce the risk of violence, UNMISS peacekeepers have adopted a more mobile approach by establishing temporary operating bases near seasonal cattle migration routes.

The delegation is concerned that violence this year could evolve into something similar to that witnessed in early 2020 when thousands of fighters Dinka, Nuer, Murle communities conducted attacks on villages, killing and wounding hundreds of civilians. While acknowledging that the current fragile situation has begun to improve gradually, the delegates from the AUMISS, IGAD, R-JMEC, ADC and UNMISS called on the Transitional Government of South Sudan, together with community leaders in Greater Pibor and Jonglei, to take steps to silence the guns, address the root causes of the conflict and fulfil its responsibility to protect civilians. The delegation plans to visit other areas of greater Jonglei to reiterate this message.

AUMISS, IGAD, R-JMEC, ADC, and UNMISS, along with the broader international community, will continue to do everything possible to support the Government and people of South Sudan. However, the delegation stressed that the protection of citizens from intercommunal violence, and providing support to the internally displaced South Sudanese, is first and foremost the responsibility of the Government. Further, the delegation appealed to the Government for a speedy establishment of the local administrative structures in the Area, while urging for the 35% level of women’s representation to be met.

At the outset of today’s meeting, the 15‑member organ endorsed a presidential statement (to be issued as document S/PRST/2021/20), presented by Kenya, Council President for October, by which the Secretary‑General is requested to establish an integrated electoral assistance team led by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), in support of the electoral road map detailed in the peace agreement of 2018.

In the statement, the Council underscored that elections must be preceded by an inclusive, transparent constitution-drafting process, carried out in an environment that respects freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, and encourages civic engagement.

The Council then urged the South Sudanese authorities to make progress on key milestones, including the necessary security arrangements, the establishment of the legal framework for elections, and the establishment of a functioning National Election Commission both in Juba and at the subnational level.

One would keep overall force numbers close to what they are currently, and the second would slightly reduce the troop ceiling, a move that will require more operational adjustments but should encourage Sudan and South Sudan to move forward on outstanding issues with increased urgency.

It is also recommended that the United Nations establishes a rule of law support strategy, and keeps the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism intact, he said, adding that negotiations towards a political settlement concerning Abyei remain crucial building blocks towards an exit strategy for UNISFA.

This event offers a platform for South Sudan’s leaders to develop mutual priorities for an interconnected and purposeful government, one that is equipped to advance the search for lasting peace in South Sudan.

Following the appointment of state governors and other constitutional post holders, UNMISS had immediately embarked on a series of interactive dialogues to foster political cohesion and trust between members of the coalition state governments.

As precursor to this Forum, UNMISS facilitated nine Governor’s Forums in all states except Unity, due to devastating floods. These events facilitated engagements between state governors and local stakeholders to identify governance-related priorities in their respective states and prepare action plans towards delivering them.

We are pleased that these Governors’ Forums led to the creation of a strategic plan for each state, addressing priorities enshrined in the Revitalized Agreement. These plans will be presented to you here over the coming days.
We have also organised six State Leadership Retreats around the theme of “Building Trust and Confidence for United and Inclusive Governments”. Here, we disseminated the Revitalized Agreement to encourage greater ownership of its priorities. Importantly, these retreats offered an opportunity for the state governments to better appreciate their respective roles and to foster the much-needed state-level synergies for unity.

These activities served as a timely entry point for capacity-building, training, and general brainstorming. They also offered a formal introduction for newly appointed office holders at the grassroots level. In some states, the Mission has cascaded this approach to the county commissioners as well as the Payam level.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/statement-mr-nicholas-haysom-special-representative-secretary-general-5th,The term 'other' refers to the training and capacity building offered by UNMISS. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

People living in Lohutok and Ibahure payams (administrative divisions) are perhaps worst affected by this ongoing violence, as a patrol team from the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) discovered.

“We are tired of the constant fighting,” stated Pasqual Osenger, a traditional leader from Lohutok, to visiting peacekeepers. “It has left us without security, affected our crops and livestock and our general quality of life. We request UNMISS to ensure that this conflict between our communities ends once and for all.”

Lack of proper rule of law and security institutions in the area have, unfortunately, empowered perpetrators.

While speaking to the patrolling peacekeepers, community leaders stressed the need for established law and order mechanisms as well as reconciliation activities here. “To keep the peace between us, we believe we need a proper security system and well-demarcated areas where both communities can coexist peacefully,” added Mr. Osenger.

UNMISS has made several efforts in the past to reconcile the communities of these two payams. However, the peacekeeping mission hasn’t had much success in establishing a sustained peace.

“The UN has tried many times to resolve issues between us,” revealed a youth representative. “However, because of our own long history and disagreements between our leaders, no agreement has held till now. We seem to relapse into conflict at the slightest issue and we are aware that this must stop.”

For its part, UNMISS, through its Civil Affairs Division, has re-started engaging with communities across South Sudan in general, and Lafon, in particular, to sensitize them on the provisions contained within the Revitalized Peace Agreement.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/traditional-leaders-lopit-call-unmiss-reconcile-feuding-communities-lafon-eastern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Force Commander’s visit came on the heels of recent intercommunal clashes. The most recent upsurge of violence in early July displaced some 5,000 people; schools, churches, and health centers were vandalized and a World Food Programme warehouse was looted by armed youth .

Wol Mario Maalok, acting payam administrator in Marial Lou briefed the visiting delegation on the situation. “The conflict between all of us has taken a toll and all parties have agreed that the only way forward for us is to resolve things peacefully so that our children can live free of fear and retaliation. In fact, many people who had fled when the clashes initially began, have now started returning to their homes.”

However, humanitarian needs still to be addressed.

“We lack medical facilities, shelter and food, though the presence of UNMISS peacekeepers here has enabled hospital staff to resume their duties. Many people lost everything during the conflict, and they need help to get back on their feet,” added Mr Maalok.

For her part, Acting Governor Akiech reiterated the state administration’s commitment to supporting long-term peace and conflict resolution in Marial Lou, saying that the government is in the process of convening a peace dialogue between the three feuding communities.

We commend the parties’ efforts to garner support for this framework agreement from a broad range of Sudanese actors and their call for continued, inclusive dialogue on all issues of concern and cooperation to build the future of Sudan.

We urge all Sudanese actors to engage in this dialogue urgently and in good faith.

The trilateral mechanism, consisting of the United Nations, the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), continued its efforts to support Sudanese stakeholders in fostering a political agreement. Several local political initiatives focused on arrangements for a possible future transitional period were put forward by political and civilian forces. On 10 September, the Sudanese Bar Association presented its draft constitution to the mechanism. The draft was developed by a committee composed of various political party groupings, civil society organizations and prominent academics. It was signed by the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC)-Central Council, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)-Original, the Popular Congress Party and Ansar al-Sunna, among other groups, as well as a range of civil society organizations, women’s groups and professional associations.

4. In subsequent weeks, the signatories of the Sudanese Bar Association draft constitution continued their efforts to broaden their support base, build consensus and address the remaining issues in the text with a view to setting the stage for negotiations with the military. In parallel, bilateral negotiations between some signatories of the draft constitution and the military resulted in a preliminary understanding on key issues between them. On 24 October, the trilateral mechanism received comments from the military based on that preliminary understanding and was asked by the military to launch a structured political process to facilitate negotiations on the remaining differences. Subsequently, the mechanism engaged intensively with the stakeholders to facilitate political talks aimed at reaching a broadbased civilian and military agreement. On 6 November, in a speech to soldiers and officers at Hattab military base in Khartoum, the Chairperson of the Sovereign Council and the Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, in the presence of the Chief of Staff and Heads of Units, confirmed that understandings had been reached with the civilian component, underscoring that the military was not aligned with any political group, and warned the National Congress Party, the Islamist Movement and others that they would not be allowed to return through the armed forces. On 13 November, Lieutenant General Al-Burhan spoke at the Markhiyat operational base reiterating similar messaging.

5. The Sudan Liberation Movement-Transitional Council and the Gathering of the Sudan Liberation Forces, both signatories of the Juba Agreement for Peace in the Sudan, participated in the work of the Sudanese Bar Association.

Peace talks between the latter faction and the Government of the Sudan have not yet resumed, pending the restoration of a civilian Government and a return to constitutional order.

6. Other civilian forces also presented alternative visions for the transitional period.

This is an essential first step toward establishing a civilian-led government and defining constitutional arrangements to guide Sudan through a transitional period culminating in elections. We commend the parties’ efforts to garner support for this framework agreement from a broad range of Sudanese actors and their call for continued, inclusive dialogue on all issues of concern and cooperation to build the future of Sudan.

We urge all Sudanese actors to engage in this dialogue urgently and in good faith. We acknowledge the military has made clear it is ready to step back from politics and engage constructively in the ongoing dialogue. We call on all parties to put Sudan’s national interest above narrow political ends. We also fully support the UNITAMS-AU-IGAD (the Tripartite Mechanism) role in facilitating these negotiations and call on all parties to do the same. Quad and Troika members support this Sudanese-led process and condemn spoilers attempting to restrict political space and undermine Sudan’s stability and democratic transition.

A concerted effort to finalize negotiations and reach agreement quickly to form a new civilian-led government is essential to address Sudan’s urgent political, economic, security, and humanitarian challenges. This is the key to unlocking the resumption of international development assistance and deeper cooperation between the government of Sudan and international partners. We are working with partners to coordinate significant economic support to a civilian-led transitional government to help address the challenges facing the people of Sudan.""",https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sudan-quad-and-troika-joint-statement-december-2022,"""3. The trilateral mechanism, consisting of the United Nations, the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), continued its efforts to support Sudanese stakeholders in fostering a political agreement. Several local political initiatives focused on arrangements for a possible future transitional period were put forward by political and civilian forces. On 10 September, the Sudanese Bar Association presented its draft constitution to the mechanism. The draft was developed by a committee composed of various political party groupings, civil society organizations and prominent academics. It was signed by the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC)-Central Council, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)-Original, the Popular Congress Party and Ansar al-Sunna, among other groups, as well as a range of civil society organizations, women’s groups and professional associations.

4. In subsequent weeks, the signatories of the Sudanese Bar Association draft constitution continued their efforts to broaden their support base, build consensus and address the remaining issues in the text with a view to setting the stage for negotiations with the military. In parallel, bilateral negotiations between some signatories of the draft constitution and the military resulted in a preliminary understanding on key issues between them. On 24 October, the trilateral mechanism received comments from the military based on that preliminary understanding and was asked by the military to launch a structured political process to facilitate negotiations on the remaining differences. Subsequently, the mechanism engaged intensively with the stakeholders to facilitate political talks aimed at reaching a broadbased civilian and military agreement. On 6 November, in a speech to soldiers and officers at Hattab military base in Khartoum, the Chairperson of the Sovereign Council and the Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, in the presence of the Chief of Staff and Heads of Units, confirmed that understandings had been reached with the civilian component, underscoring that the military was not aligned with any political group, and warned the National Congress Party, the Islamist Movement and others that they would not be allowed to return through the armed forces. On 13 November, Lieutenant General Al-Burhan spoke at the Markhiyat operational base reiterating similar messaging.

5. The Sudan Liberation Movement-Transitional Council and the Gathering of the Sudan Liberation Forces, both signatories of the Juba Agreement for Peace in the Sudan, participated in the work of the Sudanese Bar Association. Meanwhile, non-signatories reiterated their refusal to participate. The Sudan Liberation Movement-Abdel Wahid (SLM/AW) faction rejected dialogue with the military. The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction criticized the document for its failure to address the root causes of the conflict. Peace talks between the latter faction and the Government of the Sudan have not yet resumed, pending the restoration of a civilian Government and a return to constitutional order.

6. Other civilian forces also presented alternative visions for the transitional period. On 28 September, the resistance committees of Khartoum published a document, entitled The Revolutionary Charter to Establish People’s Power, which was signed by some committees from 18 states across the Sudan. The Charter was intended to unify the resistance committees around a broad political vision that included a revolutionary legislative council, formed through a grass-roots process, that would serve as the supreme authority and through which the Prime Minister would be selected. On 8 October, FFC-National Consensus (which includes some signatories of the Juba Peace Agreement), FFC-National Forces, DUP-Original and other parties signed a political declaration that included a proposal for amending the 2019 Constitutional Document""",https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/situation-sudan-and-activities-united-nations-integrated-transition-assistance-mission-sudan-report-secretary-general-s2022898-enar,"""Volker Perthes, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sudan and Head of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS), noted that military leadership and political actors signed a political framework on Monday, 5 December, which may lead to the formation of a new civilian Government and democratic elections over a two-year transition phase.

A final political agreement, once reached, will lead to a civilian government that should be in a better position to address the security, humanitarian and economic situation, should pave the way towards building a democratic state based on human rights, rule of law and gender equality, and provide a future for the young men and women of Sudan.

The delegation encouraged the reaffirmation by both the President and the First Vice President that they would not return the country to war, urging them to de-escalate the heightened political tensions, dialogue amongst themselves to address any concerns, and return to full implementation of the Agreement. In the meeting with the President, the delegation acknowledged his intervention by him through the news conference of Monday 28 March 2022, which helped reduce the anxieties in Juba and across the country.

When recent political tensions are added to the mix, as is the case in Raja County in Western Bahr-el-Ghazal State, the task becomes even more complex.

“The frictions we are witnessing risk leading to intercommunal conflicts resulting in huge losses of lives and property. For this reason, our youth must change their attitudes when it comes to revenge attacks. They need to understand that peaceful dialogue is the way to create social cohesion and unity,” said Santino Kornick Sali, Executive Director in Raja County.

To discuss and address these issues, the national non-governmental organization Community Empowerment for Progress Organization (CEPO), the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and the state government gathered key stakeholder in the area for a two-day dialogue.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/unmiss-addresses-intercommunal-tensions-dialogue-forum-raja-county,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In past years, communities from Akoka, Baliet, Fashoda, Makal and Panyikang have been at loggerheads, with disputes among them often escalating into full-blown conflict that led to loss of lives and property as well as large-scale displacement.

However, this meeting sought to promote an inclusive dialogue between leaders of these sparring communities with the ultimate aim of transforming enmity into a shared commitment to a prosperous, peaceful future.

The interactive sessions dealt with a range of topics such as the Revitalized Peace Agreement, the government’s perspective on inter-county coordination, early warning mechanisms, the role of traditional authorities in conflict prevention and reconciliation, and the vital contributions of women as well as youth in promoting peace.

Normal life has been completely disrupted; many people have abandoned their homes and farms, fleeing to safer locations, including outside the country.

Aid agencies struggle even to raise enough money to feed the victims because South Sudan has become invisible in the wake of other crises around the world,” he added.

From 12 to 18 October 2022, they held meetings with the Africa Union (AU) leadership, departments and Member States, the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), diplomatic corps and UN representatives, civil society and other actors.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/urgent-action-needed-peace-agreement-south-sudan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rt. Honorable Speaker and Deputy Speakers,

State Governors and Administrators of Administrative Areas

Ministers and Deputy Ministers,

Members of Parliament and the Council of States,

Excellencies and distinguished guests,

I am deeply honored to address the commencement of the Sixth Governor’s Forum, which recognizes the urgency of implementing the 2022 Roadmap. This is an opportunity to reflect on South Sudan’s recommitment to the Revitalized Peace Agreement. I commend the leadership of South Sudan’s government and the parties for reaching a consensus on the way forward and the ratification of the Roadmap only last week by the Transitional National Legislature.

I am pleased to see the nation’s leaders - from the bomas, payams, counties and capitals - coming together under one roof under the leadership of the government of the country. And over the next week, you will take forward conversations generated at state-level to inform a common understanding of priorities and challenges at the national level. A key theme of your deliberations will be the pathways towards a stable and prosperous nation so that every woman, man and child can benefit both peace and the natural abundance of this country. This process carries with it the added strength of the states moving together with the center, reinforced by the participation of civil society, of partners and the international community. We look forward to the full inclusion of women’s voices in this important dialogue.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/sixth-governors-forum-statement-mr-nicholas-haysom-special-representative-secretary-general-and-head-unmiss,,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/sixth-governors-forum-closing-session-statement-mr-nicholas-haysom-special-representative-secretary-general-and-head-unmiss-30-november-2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The meeting, which was held in Juba, was co-chaired by the Sudanese Minister of Defence, Lieutenant General Yassin Ibrahim Yassin, and the South Sudan Minister of Defence and Veterans Affairs, Hon. Angelina Teny. Their delegations included Ministers and high-level representatives of security institutions. The collective vision of the parties was to operationalize the commitments made by H.E Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan and H.E Abdel Fattah Al Burhan, Chairman of the Transitional Sovereign Council of Sudan during their meeting in Juba on 12 January 2023, which focused on the strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries.

The UNISFA delegation, led by the Deputy Force Commander Brig. Gen. Abu Syed Mohammod Bakir, highlighted the challenging security situation in Abyei and the Safe Demilitarized Border Zone (SDBZ) and the need for concerted efforts to enhance the protection of civilians. UNISFA also underscored several issues, including the need to reoperationalize the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (JBVMM) Sector 1 (Gok Machar), the deployment of national monitors at Abu Qussa, the redeployment of government forces from Abyei and the SDBZ and freedom of movement challenges. Other matters discussed included support for the commencement of intercommunal talks, including the seasonal peace conference, and the resumption of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee meetings.

The parties welcomed the report presented by UNISFA and JBVMM and adopted its recommendations. They directed the Chief of Defence Forces of the Republic of South Sudan and the Chief of Staff of the Sudanese Armed Forces to inter alia form a committee to “monitor the implementation of the resolution of the JPSM regarding the redeployment of own forces outside of the SDBZ”.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/parties-agree-hasten-implementation-decisions-during-jpsm-meeting-juba,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
