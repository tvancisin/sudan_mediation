However, on 16 August 1986, the peace talks were suspended due to the SPLM/A bombing a civil airplane, which resulted in the death of 60 passengers. Egypt – in spite of its military support to the Government of Sudan – managed to facilitate contacts between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and SPLM/A in the mid-1988. The DUP was one of the three parties in Khartoum’s ruling coalition. Ethiopia subsequently offered to host talks in Addis Ababa between the DUP and the SPLM/A. This led to the signing of what has been referred to as the DUP-SPLM/A Sudan Peace Agreement on 16 November 1988 by DUP leader Mohamed Osman al-Mirghani and SPLM/A leader John Garang de Mabior. However, the agreement soon collapsed as a result of an internal power struggle within the Government of Sudan. The opposition in the coalition government, the National Islamic Front (NIF), did not accept the peace agreement, as it wished to maintain Islamic law and refused to abrogate military pacts with Egypt and Libya. The NIF denounced the talks as a conspiracy to block Islamic law. Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi voted down a DUP amendment to recognise the terms of the DUP-SPLM/A Sudan Peace Agreement. Consequently, the DUP resigned from government on 27 December 1988. In March 1989, a new Government assumed power, which proposed a peace plan that was based on the peace deal that was reached between SPLM/A and DUP in November 1988, calling for a freeze on Islamic laws.

Both Bashir and Garang accepted the invitation and the meeting was set for 27 February 1990. However, at the last minute Garang decided not to go, so only Bashir showed up.  Similarly, Zaire and Egypt mediated in 1990, but could not bring the conflict parties to the negotiation table. The Government of Sudan took the initiative in March 1990 to request the US to mediate. The US subsequently initiated a mediation effort. In order to move the conflict parties towards a peace settlement, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman Cohen began to shuttle between the conflict parties in March 1990. Cohen formulated a proposal that stipulated the conclusion of a ceasefire, withdrawal of troops, followed by a constitutional conference that would decide on a federal system. With regard to the withdrawal of troops, Cohen proposed the complete evacuation of the national army to positions north of the 11th parallel, while the SPLM/A had to guarantee that it would not take control of southern Sudan militarily if the government forces would withdraw. With neither conflict party agreeing to this proposal, Cohen subsequently formulated a new proposal, which stipulated that half of the government forces would be pulled out from southern Sudan, while the SPLM/A would in exchange withdraw all its troops 15 kilometres from the besieged towns. Moreover, the withdrawal of troops would be internationally monitored. Cohen also proposed to hold a constitutional conference . Cohen personally presented the adapted proposal to President al-Bashir in Khartoum on 9 March 1990. While al-Bashir promised Cohen to study the proposal carefully, he soon conveyed that he rejected the possibility of a constitutional conference, preferring bilateral talks with John Garrang. The Government of Sudan also refused to withdraw from some garrison towns in areas controlled by the rebels including some oil fields.  This terminated his round of shuttle talks in March 1990. In May, Cohen again tried to imitate a peace conference, but the government side officially rejected this option on 4 June 1990.""",APP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coup led to the formation of an umbrella opposition group called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). In 1990, the SPLM/A joined the NDA, which at the time was a non-militant opposition group. The NDA aimed to remove the regime and set up a democratic system in Sudan. The NDA further envisioned that as part of this new democratic system the people in the South would have the right to a referendum on self-determination. The NDA was fairly loosely organised, composed of a variety of different entities such as civil society organisations, as well as rebel groups. Groups taking part in the alliance have on several occasions acted on their own, both when it comes to negotiations with and fighting against the government. Until 1996, the NDA was a solely political platform, but in September 1996, the NDA decided to set up a joint military force. After this point the NDA was both an umbrella organisation and an organisation with its own military and commanders fighting under the NDA banner.

On 14 March 2003, the Darfur based SLM/A stated in a press release that it shall fight for a secular Sudan with a decentralised form of governance, using armed struggle as one of the means to achieve this political goal. By the time this press statement was released the armed conflict had already begun. One of the first organized attacks took place as early as June 2002, when Darfurian rebels targeted a police station in Golo. Yet, it was not until March 2003 that the armed conflict escalated, when several coordinated armed attacks led by SLM/A leader Abdel Wahid were launched on various government army units. When the armed opposition groups took up arms, the Sudanese government initially kept the communication channels open. For instance, after the attack on the police station in Golo in June 2002, the Sudanese government dispatched the chairman of the Parliament’s Transport Commission, Idris Yusuf, to negotiate with the armed groups.  From March 2003 onwards, when attacks on government targets became more frequent, the Governor of North Darfur, Ibrahim Suleiman, formed and ad hoc Darfur Security Committee to negotiate an end to the violence in Darfur. However, this peace effort was terminated as soon as government officials had successfully negotiated the return of commander of the Sudanese air force Ibrahim Bushra, who had been captured during the attack on El Fasher airbase.

On 9 June 2011, the SPLM/A-North expressed that it fought to remove the central Government in Khartoum. Abdel-Aziz Al-Hilu, a leading figure in the movement and the former deputy Governor of South Kordofan, stated the SPLM/A-North waged a “battle for dignity to accomplish the fundamental change in the centre.” The conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile can be seen as a continuation of the civil war between the Sudanese government and the SPLM/A between 1983 and 2005. While fighters from these two areas joined the SPLM/A rebellion as early as 1984. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) concluded in 2005 stipulated a referendum on independence for southern Sudan, but this referendum did not apply to South Kordofan and Blue Nile. This provides the background to the SPLM/A-North rebellion. After fighting had started in June, the armed conflict quickly spread to other towns and villages in South Kordofan. In September, fighting also started in the state of Blue Nile, which is located east of South Kordofan, but the fighting in South Kordofan was more intense. The SPM/A-North was supported by the Government of South Sudan. In early June, the AU High-Level Implementation Panel on Sudan (AUHIP) led by former South African president Thabo Mbeki initiated mediated negotiations to end the fighting. SPLM/A-North chairman Malik Agar negotiated for the SPLM/A-North and Ali Nafi for the Sudanese government.This mediation effort led to the signing of a ceasefire on 16 June 2011.

In late 2016, the AUHIP called upon the SPLM/A-North to review their positions on the talks on the Two Areas.

While there were many calls to engage in negotiations throughout 2017 and 2018, the conflict parties did not engage in peace talks. The split was a result of long-simmering ethnic and political–military tensions within the SPLM/A-N in Blue Nile. While the Uduk, Berta, and Burun had made up the majority of the SPLM/A’s 10th Division during war between the SPLM/A and the Sudanese government between 1983 and 2005, members of the Ingessana tribe assumed increasingly more power within the rebel group from 2012 onwards. This led to widespread dissatisfaction among the non-Ingessana tribes. Tensions were temporarily put on hold due to intense fighting between the SPLM/A-N and government forces throughout 2015-2016, but following a unilateral ceasefire issued by the Sudanese government on 18 June 2016 tensions escalated.

Abdelaziz al-Hilu accused Agar of not fully representing the entire SPLM/A-N movement in the peace process led by the AU, particularly with regard to the issue of self-determination of the Nuba Mountains. Al-Hilu’s letter essentially forced the members of the SPLM/A-N to choose between himself and chairman Malik Agar of the Ingessana tribe.

Tensions were temporarily put on hold due to intense fighting between the SPLM/A-N and government forces throughout 2015-2016, but following a unilateral ceasefire issued by the Sudanese government on 18 June 2016 tensions escalated. In March 2017, SPLM/A-N deputy chairman Abdelaziz al-Hilu publicly released a resignation letter. Abdelaziz al-Hilu accused Agar of not fully representing the entire SPLM/A-N movement in the peace process led by the AU, particularly with regard to the issue of self-determination of the Nuba Mountains. Al-Hilu’s letter essentially forced the members of the SPLM/A-N to choose between himself and chairman Malik Agar of the Ingessana tribe. The Nuba Mountains Liberation Council (NMLC) subsequently passed resolutions that removed Arman as the SPLM/A-N’s lead negotiator with African Union High-Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP), as well as put the NMLC in power of both South Kordofan and Blue Nile. Moreover, many senior non-Ingessana leaders began to publicly voice support for al-Hilu and the NMLC. In April 2017, almost all of the non-Ingessana Blue Nile Liberation Council (BNLC) members declared their support for the NMLC decision to dismiss Arman as the SPLM/A-N AUHIP lead negotiator. Accordingly, although the deputy chairman Abdelaziz al-Hilu broke away from the rebel group led by chairman Malik Agar, the UCDP codes the SPLM/A-N led by Malik Agar (SPLM/A-N-MA) as the splinter faction because he was endorsed by the NMLC and most of the BNLC.  Preparations for official negotiations between the SPLM/A-North and the Sudanese government continued in spite of this split. SPLM/A-North representatives met with mediators from the AUHIP in Addis Ababa in late August 2017. In late September 2017, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) special envoy for Sudan, Lesane Johannes, discussed details for the resumption of formal peace talks between the SPLM-North and the government with Sudanese Presidential adviser Ibrahim Mahmoud. However, these pre-negotiations did not lead to formal negotiations between the SPLM-North and the Government of Sudan were held in 2017.""",APP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tut Gatluak said the government and the SRF, during the previous rounds, have demonstrated their seriousness to achieving true peace in Sudan. ...Since last December, the government and the SRF groups extended the talks four times without reaching a final peace deal as discussions continue on security arrangements, power-sharing and wealth distribution.

For the talks with the SPLM-N Agar, the parties have to agree on the share of Two-Regions in the local resources and the final form of the regional authority.

For the armed groups in Darfur, the parties reached an agreement on the region’s ratio of the resources but still have to agree on the power-sharing as the armed movement claim the third of positions in the federal institutions.

Also, it should be noted that the talks between the government and the SPLM-N al-Hilu are deadlocked and there are no meetings.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-peace-talks-extended-sine-die,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though describing it as an important breakthrough, Mr. Perthes said “critical contentious issues” will need to be addressed in the final accord.   

They include security sector reform and the merger of forces, transitional justice, and implementation of the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement signed by the transitional government and several armed groups in Darfur. 

Meanwhile, UNITAMS and the UN Country Team in Sudan have already begun to coordinate with the international community d to ensure a “package” of support for a new transitional period.""",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/12/1131462,"""Statement from Norway, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the UK and the USA:

Members of the Quad and Troika (Norway, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States) welcome the agreement of an initial political framework. This is an essential first step toward establishing a civilian-led government and defining constitutional arrangements to guide Sudan through a transitional period culminating in elections. We commend the parties’ efforts to garner support for this framework agreement from a broad range of Sudanese actors and their call for continued, inclusive dialogue on all issues of concern and cooperation to build the future of Sudan.

We urge all Sudanese actors to engage in this dialogue urgently and in good faith. We acknowledge the military has made clear it is ready to step back from politics and engage constructively in the ongoing dialogue. We call on all parties to put Sudan’s national interest above narrow political ends. We also fully support the UNITAMS-AU-IGAD (the Tripartite Mechanism) role in facilitating these negotiations and call on all parties to do the same. Quad and Troika members support this Sudanese-led process and condemn spoilers attempting to restrict political space and undermine Sudan’s stability and democratic transition.

A concerted effort to finalize negotiations and reach agreement quickly to form a new civilian-led government is essential to address Sudan’s urgent political, economic, security, and humanitarian challenges. This is the key to unlocking the resumption of international development assistance and deeper cooperation between the government of Sudan and international partners. We are working with partners to coordinate significant economic support to a civilian-led transitional government to help address the challenges facing the people of Sudan.""",https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sudan-quad-and-troika-joint-statement-december-2022,"""3. The trilateral mechanism, consisting of the United Nations, the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), continued its efforts to support Sudanese stakeholders in fostering a political agreement. Several local political initiatives focused on arrangements for a possible future transitional period were put forward by political and civilian forces. On 10 September, the Sudanese Bar Association presented its draft constitution to the mechanism. The draft was developed by a committee composed of various political party groupings, civil society organizations and prominent academics. It was signed by the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC)-Central Council, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)-Original, the Popular Congress Party and Ansar al-Sunna, among other groups, as well as a range of civil society organizations, women’s groups and professional associations.

4. In subsequent weeks, the signatories of the Sudanese Bar Association draft constitution continued their efforts to broaden their support base, build consensus and address the remaining issues in the text with a view to setting the stage for negotiations with the military. In parallel, bilateral negotiations between some signatories of the draft constitution and the military resulted in a preliminary understanding on key issues between them. On 24 October, the trilateral mechanism received comments from the military based on that preliminary understanding and was asked by the military to launch a structured political process to facilitate negotiations on the remaining differences. Subsequently, the mechanism engaged intensively with the stakeholders to facilitate political talks aimed at reaching a broadbased civilian and military agreement. On 6 November, in a speech to soldiers and officers at Hattab military base in Khartoum, the Chairperson of the Sovereign Council and the Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, in the presence of the Chief of Staff and Heads of Units, confirmed that understandings had been reached with the civilian component, underscoring that the military was not aligned with any political group, and warned the National Congress Party, the Islamist Movement and others that they would not be allowed to return through the armed forces. On 13 November, Lieutenant General Al-Burhan spoke at the Markhiyat operational base reiterating similar messaging.

5. The Sudan Liberation Movement-Transitional Council and the Gathering of the Sudan Liberation Forces, both signatories of the Juba Agreement for Peace in the Sudan, participated in the work of the Sudanese Bar Association. Meanwhile, non-signatories reiterated their refusal to participate. The Sudan Liberation Movement-Abdel Wahid (SLM/AW) faction rejected dialogue with the military. The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction criticized the document for its failure to address the root causes of the conflict. Peace talks between the latter faction and the Government of the Sudan have not yet resumed, pending the restoration of a civilian Government and a return to constitutional order.

6. Other civilian forces also presented alternative visions for the transitional period. On 28 September, the resistance committees of Khartoum published a document, entitled The Revolutionary Charter to Establish People’s Power, which was signed by some committees from 18 states across the Sudan. The Charter was intended to unify the resistance committees around a broad political vision that included a revolutionary legislative council, formed through a grass-roots process, that would serve as the supreme authority and through which the Prime Minister would be selected.

Members of the Quad and Troika (Norway, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States) welcome the agreement of an initial political framework. This is an essential first step toward establishing a civilian-led government and defining constitutional arrangements to guide Sudan through a transitional period culminating in elections. We commend the parties’ efforts to garner support for this framework agreement from a broad range of Sudanese actors and their call for continued, inclusive dialogue on all issues of concern and cooperation to build the future of Sudan.

We urge all Sudanese actors to engage in this dialogue urgently and in good faith. We acknowledge the military has made clear it is ready to step back from politics and engage constructively in the ongoing dialogue. We call on all parties to put Sudan’s national interest above narrow political ends. We also fully support the UNITAMS-AU-IGAD (the Tripartite Mechanism) role in facilitating these negotiations and call on all parties to do the same. Quad and Troika members support this Sudanese-led process and condemn spoilers attempting to restrict political space and undermine Sudan’s stability and democratic transition.

Until yesterday, the Community Protection Committee was only operational in the Southern part of the Abyei Area despite sustained efforts by UNISFA and consistent appeals by successive UNISFA resolutions to also establish it in the Northern part of the Area.

According to UNISFA Acting Head of Mission and Force Commander, Major General Benjamin Olufemi Sawyerr, the inauguration of the CPC comprising one hundred and sixty-two (161) volunteers including seven (7)) women fully endorsed by the traditional leadership and the local administration to serve as Community Protection Committee members in the Northern Sector of the Abyei Area is therefore ground-breaking. He announced that the inauguration would be closely followed by strengthening of the criminal justice system by bringing on board courts such as traditional courts and other forms of courts within Municipal law to handle criminal matters reported at CPC stations.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/history-made-unisfa-establishes-community-protection-committee-northern-abyei,The term 'other' refers to the inauguration of the Community Protection Committee with the support of UNISFA (UN).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
